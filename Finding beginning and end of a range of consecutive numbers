Exercise #1: Find the beginning and end of a range of consecutive numbers (groups) using the employees hired on the same date.


Solution #1: We find the beginning and end of consecutive numbers (groups) by assigning employees into groups based on their hiring date using WINDOW functions.
Since their are a few employees that changed departments, we will use column "StartDate" from table [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[EmployeeDepartmentHistory].
This means that the StartDate is understood as the date an employee started to work on their current department.

Tables used: 
1) [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Employee]
2) [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[EmployeeDepartmentHistory]
3) [AdventureWorks2022].[HumanResources].[Department]

	Query #1: We group the employees that were hired on the same date using window functions ROW_NUMBER and LAG
	---------
SELECT StartDateGroupNumber.RowNumber				-- EmployeesGroupedByHiringDateLevel4

, StartDateGroupNumber.BusinessEntityID
